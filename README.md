# andymcdgeo_examples
This repository contains all of the code examples I use in my YouTube videos and Medium articles. These will be from October 2023 onwards. Previous code examples and notebooks will be linked to directly within the YouTube video description or Medium article.

Within each of my YouTube videos from October 2023, you will find a link to the code used in the video description.

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this repository or to any bug related issues, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

# Data Sources
All data used within my tutorials can be found within the data subfolder. This is organised by source and appropriate references are included. Additional data may be included which has been derived from the source data. This will be explained in the relevant article or video.

If you have cloned this repository, then all the relative locations used within the examples should work. However, if you experience issues or have downloaded a specific file, then you may need to use an absolute reference to the data on your local machine.
